\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
In today's digital world, the ability 
to interpret emotions from written text 
has gained importance for a variety of 
applications, including customer feedback 
analysis and mental health monitoring. 
Emotion classification, a challenging 
task within natural language processing, 
focuses on identifying the emotional 
tone within text.

This work compares the performance of
three different models for emotion
classification: Decision Trees, Random
Forests and Neural Networks. The models
were trained on a dataset of online 
messages labeled with 7 different
emotions: Happiness, Sadness, Anger,
Worry, Love, Surprise and Neutral.
