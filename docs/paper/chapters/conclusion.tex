\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work three different kinds of
machine learning algorithms were compared
in the task of emotion classification from
text. Random forest has proven to be the best
performing model among the ones tested while
the decision tree was the most stable one.
The neural network was the worst performing
model, but it was the one that had the most
room for improvement. Unfortunately, the 
computational resources available
were not enough to explore more hyperparameters
and configurations for the neural network.

\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

The neural network model has great room for
improvement and maybe a more modern 
architecture like a transformer could have
better results. Also exploring more
hyperparameters for every model could
lead to better results.
