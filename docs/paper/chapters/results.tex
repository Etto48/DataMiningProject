\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The models were compared using their mean
F1 (normalized by class) in the 6-folds 
over the validation set. We can se the 
results for each model in
\autoref{fig:model_selection}.

Among the models tested in this work, 
the best one was the \textbf{neural network} 
followed by the \textbf{random forest} and then 
the \textbf{decision treee}.
The best models for each kind are shown in
\autoref{tab:best_model_per_kind} and their
respective hyperparameters are shown in
\autoref{tab:hyperparameters_best_neural_network},
\autoref{tab:hyperparameters_best_random_forest} and
\autoref{tab:hyperparameters_best_decision_tree}.

The best model was selected based on 
the average F1 obtained in the
cross-validation. The F1 distribution
of this model was compared to the other
models with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
\input{dynamic/similar_models}

As we can see in 
\autoref{fig:f1_distribution}, the random
forest is the most susceptible to
hyperparameter changes, as it has the widest
F1 distribution, while the decision tree
is the least susceptible but still 
the worse performing, with the smallest
F1 distribution. The neural network
is in the middle, with a distribution
skewed to higher F1 values.
